### Introduction
This project has been a collaborative work to recreate the algorythm used by Petros Vrellis in his recreation of
El Greco's Jesus:

## Notes
May cause overheating.
Reduce risk by lowering the number of nails used.
First ~5 strings might take a couple of minutes to calculate.
A small example sketch on how to calculate the distance between nails for 160 nails is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18TaQ2PdBETvY7pXxIqgkbc5qdyMHizVC/view?usp=sharing). The program sets the first nail (nail 0) at the rightmost point, as seen in the image above.
